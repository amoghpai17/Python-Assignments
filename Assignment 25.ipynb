    "A generator is a special type of iterator that is defined using a function with a yield statement. When a generator function is called, it returns a generator object that can be used to iterate over the values produced by the function. Each time the yield statement is encountered, the current value is returned to the caller, and the state of the function is saved so that it can be resumed later to produce the next value.\n",

The purpose of the yield statement is to temporarily suspend the execution of the function and return a value to the caller, while preserving the function's state. When the function is called again, execution resumes from the point where it was suspended, and continues until the next yield statement is encountered."
