    "ANS- The difference between a string and a variable is that a string is a type of data that represents a sequence of characters, while a variable is a named storage location that can hold a value of any data type, including strings. In other words, a string is a specific type of data, while a variable is a general concept for storing data. A variable can hold a string value, but it can also hold other types of values.\n"
