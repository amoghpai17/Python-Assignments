    "Q1. Describe three applications for exception processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS-\n",
    "1 - Error handling: Exception processing is commonly used for error handling. When an error occurs during the execution of a program, an exception is thrown. The exception can be caught by the program and handled in a way that allows the program to continue running without crashing. For example, if a file is not found when a program attempts to open it, an exception can be thrown and caught to notify the user of the error and prompt them to choose a different file.\n",
    "\n",
    "2 - Resource management: Exception processing can also be used for resource management. In software programming, resources such as memory, file handles, or network connections must be allocated and released properly. If an exception occurs during the allocation or release of a resource, the resource may not be properly cleaned up, leading to memory leaks or other problems. Exception processing can be used to ensure that resources are properly released, even if an exception occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 - Input validation: Exception processing can also be used for input validation. When a program accepts input from a user or external source, the input may not always be in the expected format or within acceptable ranges. Exception processing can be used to catch input that is invalid or outside the expected range, allowing the program to handle the input in a way that prevents errors or security vulnerabilities. For example, if a program expects a number between 1 and 100, an exception can be thrown if a user enters a letter or a number outside that range."

    "Q2. What happens if you don't do something extra to treat an exception?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS-\n",
    "If you don't do something extra to treat an exception, the exception will typically propagate up the call stack until it is caught by a handler that is capable of handling it. If no handler is found, the program will terminate and an error message will be displayed to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an exception is not handled, it can cause unexpected behavior in the program, such as data corruption or memory leaks. In some cases, an unhandled exception can also pose a security risk by exposing sensitive information or allowing an attacker to take control of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, it is important to handle exceptions in a proper way by providing an appropriate error message to the user or taking corrective action to prevent the program from crashing or behaving unexpectedly. Exception handling can help to make programs more robust and reliable, and it is an important aspect of software development."

    "Q3. What are your options for recovering from an exception in your script?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS-\n",
    "1 - Try-catch blocks: One common approach to handling exceptions is to use try-catch blocks. A try block contains the code that might raise an exception, while a catch block is used to handle the exception if it occurs. By catching the exception, you can take corrective action to recover from the error, such as displaying an error message to the user or attempting to retry the operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2 - raceful degradation: Another approach is to gracefully degrade the functionality of the program in the face of exceptions. For example, if a file cannot be read, the program could continue to operate using default values or cached data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 - Retry logic: If an operation fails due to an exception, it may be possible to retry the operation again. For example, if a network connection fails, the program could attempt to reconnect and retry the operation a certain number of times before giving up.\n",
    "\n",
    "4 - Logging: Exception information can be logged to help diagnose and debug the problem. This can help developers understand the cause of the exception and take corrective action to prevent it from occurring in the future."

    "Q4. Describe two methods for triggering exceptions in your script.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS-\n",
    "1 - Raise an exception: You can explicitly raise an exception in your script by using the \"raise\" keyword followed by an exception object. For example, if a function expects a positive integer as input, we could raise a ValueError exception if the input is negative. \n",
    "\n",
    "2 - Use built-in functions: Many built-in functions in Python can raise exceptions in certain circumstances. For example, the \"open\" function can raise a FileNotFoundError exception if the file specified in the argument does not exist. Similarly, the \"int\" function can raise a ValueError exception if the argument cannot be converted to an integer. To handle these exceptions, we can use try-catch blocks or other exception handling mechanisms."

    "Q5. Identify two methods for specifying actions to be executed at termination time, regardless of\n",
    "whether or not an exception exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS-\n",
    "1 - The try-finally block: The try-finally block allows you to specify a set of cleanup actions that will be executed regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. The \"finally\" block is executed immediately after the try block, regardless of whether an exception is raised or not. This can be useful for cleaning up resources or ensuring that certain actions are always performed, regardless of the program's state.\n",
    "\n",
    "2 - The atexit module: The atexit module provides a way to register functions that will be executed when the program exits, regardless of whether an exception is raised or not. These functions are registered using the \"atexit.register()\" method."
