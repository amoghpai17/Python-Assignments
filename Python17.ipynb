    "To transform a greedy pattern into a non-greedy one, you can introduce a question mark '?' after the quantifier that specifies the pattern's repetition.

    "\n",
    "ANS-\n",
    "Greedy versus non-greedy matching makes a difference when there are multiple possible matches for a pattern in a given string. In such cases, greedy matching will consume as much of the string as possible, potentially resulting in a longer match than desired. Non-greedy matching, on the other hand, will consume as little of the string as possible, resulting in a shorter match.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are looking for a non-greedy match, but the only available match is greedy, you can modify the pattern to make it non-greedy. As mentioned in the previous answer, adding a question mark after the quantifier is the simplest way to make a greedy pattern non-greedy. However, it's important to note that modifying the pattern may change the matched substring, so it's important to carefully consider the desired output when choosing between greedy and non-greedy matching."
