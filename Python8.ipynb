    "\n",
    "ANS-\n",
    "When a class-based exception is raised, the interpreter first checks to see if there is a matching except clause that handles that specific exception class or one of its superclasses. The except clause should specify the exception class or a tuple of exception classes that it can handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also raise and handle exceptions that are instances of custom exception classes that you define yourself. The process for matching custom exceptions to handlers is the same as for built-in exceptions: the interpreter looks for a matching except clause that can handle the specific exception class or one of its superclasses."

    "\n",
    "ANS-\n",
    "String-based exceptions were used in older versions of Python to raise and catch exceptions by specifying error messages as strings.\n",
    "There are several reasons why string-based exceptions have been deprecated:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 - Lack of clarity and consistency:\n",
    "String-based exceptions were often unclear and inconsistent, and could be confusing for both developers and users. For example, different parts of the codebase might raise exceptions with slightly different error messages, which could make it difficult to track down the root cause of a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "2 - Limited functionality:\n",
    "String-based exceptions were also limited in terms of functionality. They did not provide a way to attach additional information or context to the exception, and did not allow for custom exception classes or other advanced exception handling features.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 - Security concerns:\n",
    "String-based exceptions could also be used to execute arbitrary code, which could be a security risk. For example, an attacker could use a specially-crafted string-based exception to execute code or gain access to sensitive information."
