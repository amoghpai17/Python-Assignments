    "\n",
    "ANS-\n",
    "Multiple inheritance is a feature of object-oriented programming languages where a class can inherit properties and behaviors from more than one parent class. In other words, a child class can inherit attributes and methods from multiple base or parent classes."

    "\n",
    "ANS-\n",
    "Delegation is a programming concept where an object or method passes on a responsibility or task to another object or method to perform on its behalf. In other words, an object delegates a task to another object to carry out, rather than performing the task itself."

    "\n",
    "ANS-\n",
    "Bound methods are a concept in object-oriented programming that refers to a method of an object that is bound to the object itself. This means that the method can access and modify the state of the object, and is implicitly passed the object as its first argument when it is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bound methods can be useful for encapsulating behavior within an object and allowing the object to control its own state. They can also be passed as arguments to other methods or functions, or stored as attributes of other objects."

    "\n",
    "ANS-\n",

    "\n",
    "The purpose of pseudoprivate attributes is to provide a way to create private attributes that are not accessible from outside the class, while also allowing subclasses to override or extend the attribute if necessary. By mangling the attribute name, it reduces the risk of accidental name conflicts with other attributes in the program.\n",
