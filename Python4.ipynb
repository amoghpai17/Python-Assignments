    "To support iteration in a custom class in Python, we can use the following two operator overloading methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 - __iter__: This method returns an iterator object and is called when an iteration starts. It should return an object that implements the __next__ method.\n",
    "\n",
    "2 - __next__: This method returns the next value from the iterator. It should raise a StopIteration exception when there are no more items to return."

    "\n",
    "ANS-\n",
    "1 - __str__: This method is used to return a string representation of the object. It is called when str() is called on the object or when the object is used in a string context, such as with string concatenation or string formatting. The string returned by __str__ should be a human-readable representation of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "2 - __repr__: This method is used to return a string representation of the object that can be used to recreate the object. It is called when repr() is called on the object or when the object is displayed in the interactive console. The string returned by __repr__ should be a complete representation of the object that can be used to create a new instance of the object with the same state."
