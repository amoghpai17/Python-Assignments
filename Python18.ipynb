    "\n",
    "ANS-\n",
    "Text files and binary files are two different types of computer files. Text files are files that contain only human-readable characters, such as letters, numbers, punctuation, and whitespace, encoded using a character encoding such as ASCII or Unicode. Text files are used to store textual data, such as source code, configuration files, and documents. Binary files, on the other hand, contain non-textual data, such as images, videos, executable programs, and compressed files. Binary files are not human-readable, as they contain data in the form of bytes or bits, which can represent any kind of information, including text, but are not constrained to it. Binary files are used to store any kind of data that needs to be processed by software or hardware. The key difference between text and binary files is that text files are encoded using a character encoding, while binary files are not."

    "\n",
    "ANS-\n",
    "Text files are often a better option when working with human-readable data, such as text documents, source code, configuration files, or logs. Text files can be easily created, edited, and shared using any text editor or word processor, and can be easily read and processed by humans and software alike. Text files are also typically smaller in size than binary files, as they do not require complex encoding or compression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary files, on the other hand, are preferred when dealing with non-textual data, such as images, videos, audio files, or executable programs. Binary files are optimized for performance and storage efficiency, as they can store large amounts of data in a compact format that can be easily read and processed by hardware and software. Binary files also provide better security, as they can be encrypted or compressed to protect sensitive data.\n",

    "\n",
    "ANS-\n",
    "One of the main issues with using binary operations to read and write a Python integer directly to disc is that the format and endianness of the binary representation can vary between different hardware architectures and operating systems. This means that the same binary file may be interpreted differently on different systems, leading to incorrect results or even crashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another issue is that the size of the integer may not be known in advance, especially if it is a variable-length integer. This can make it difficult to read or write the integer from or to a binary file without additional metadata or padding."

The byte offset can be relative to the current position (os.SEEK_CUR), the beginning of the file (os.SEEK_SET), or the end of the file (os.SEEK_END). The seek() method returns the new file position after the seek operation."
