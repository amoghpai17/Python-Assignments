The items are stored in a specific order, and each item can be accessed by its index (a numerical position) within the list. For example, the first item in a list has an index of 0, the second item has an index of 1, and so on.\n",

Rather than accessing items in a dictionary by their position, you access them by their associated keys. For example, if you had a dictionary that represented a person, you could access the person's name by using the key \"name\"."
