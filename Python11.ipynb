    "\n",
    "In most object-oriented programming languages, classes are themselves objects, which means that they can be instantiated, passed as arguments to functions, and manipulated at runtime. Metaclasses take advantage of this fact by providing a way to manipulate classes themselves, rather than just instances of classes.\n",

    "Custom class creation: A metaclass can define a custom class creation process, such as automatically adding certain attributes or methods to all classes created with that metaclass.\n",
    "Class validation: A metaclass can enforce constraints on the structure or behavior of classes created with that metaclass, such as requiring certain methods to be defined or disallowing certain attribute names.\n",
    "Dynamic class modification: A metaclass can modify the behavior of existing classes at runtime, such as adding or removing methods or attributes."

    "\n",
    "Class decorators are a feature introduced in Python 2.4 that allow you to modify the behavior of a class by wrapping the class definition in a function that takes the class as an argument and returns a modified version of the class. Class decorators are applied to the class after it has been defined, and can be used to add or modify methods, attributes, or other properties of the class.\n",

    "On the other hand, metaclasses are classes that define the behavior of other classes. Metaclasses are responsible for creating or modifying classes at runtime, and can be used to enforce constraints on the structure or behavior of classes, or to implement advanced features such as custom class creation or dynamic class modification."
