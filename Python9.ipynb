    "1 - Encoding: In text mode, files are read and written as Unicode text, while in binary mode, files are read and written as bytes. When working with text files, Python automatically converts the Unicode text to the appropriate encoding (such as UTF-8) when writing to the file, and converts it back to Unicode when reading from the file. In binary mode, no such conversion takes place, and the bytes are read and written exactly as they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "2 - Line Endings: In text mode, Python automatically handles different line endings (such as \"\\r\\n\" and \"\\n\") when reading and writing text files. When reading, Python converts all line endings to \"\\n\". When writing, Python uses the appropriate line ending for the platform it is running on (i.e., \"\\r\\n\" on Windows and \"\\n\" on Unix-based systems). In binary mode, no such line ending handling takes place, and the bytes are read and written exactly as they are.\n",

    "\n",
    "4 - File Modes: Text mode files can be opened in read (\"r\"), write (\"w\"), and append (\"a\") modes. In binary mode, files can be opened in read (\"rb\"), write (\"wb\"), and append (\"ab\") modes."

The first 128 characters of the Unicode character set are the same as the ASCII character set, which includes the letters of the English alphabet (uppercase and lowercase), digits, punctuation, and control characters. ASCII characters are represented in Unicode using the same code points as in the ASCII character set (i.e., from 0 to 127).\n",
