The dot product is only defined for arrays with matching dimensions, where the number of columns in the first array is equal to the number of rows in the second array. It can be computed using the np.dot() function or the @ operator in Python 3.5 and above. The dot product is useful for matrix multiplication, solving linear equations, and calculating projections and angles.\n",

    "The outer product of two arrays A and B is a matrix that is computed by multiplying each element of A by each element of B.

The outer product is useful for computing covariance matrices, calculating probabilities, and constructing tensors.\n",

    "Element-wise multiplication of two arrays A and B is performed by multiplying corresponding elements of A and B. The result is an array of the same shape as A and B.
