    "ANS-\n",
    "an absolute path starts with the root directory, which is the highest-level directory in the file system hierarchy. On Unix-based systems, the root directory is denoted by a forward slash'/', while on Windows systems, it is denoted by a drive letter followed by a colon and a backslash, such as 'C:\\' for the 'C' drive. An absolute path provides the full path to a file or directory from the root of the file system, and can be used to access the file or directory from anywhere in the file system."

However, the difference is that while dictionaries store their contents in memory, a shelf value is stored on disk, allowing you to store and access large amounts of data without using up all of your computer's memory. Like dictionaries, shelf values also consist of key-value pairs."
